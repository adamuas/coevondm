CoevoNDM - Co-operative Coevolution of Neural Diverse Machines 
An implementation of Co-operative Co-evolution for evolving the various architectural components of Artificial Neural Networks. Specifically, this involves evolving the weights, topology and choice of activation functions for each unit of the Artificial Neural Network. I released this code sometime before my PhD viva in 2016.
